//! Support for asynchronous programming on Twizzler. This crate provides executor functionality
//! along with support for async events and waiting, timers and timeouts, and a couple general
//! helper functions.
//!
//! # Executors
//! We provide three types of executors:
//!   1. block_on, which blocks until the future is completed.
//!   2. Thread-local, for futures that aren't Send.
//!   3. Global, which puts tasks in a global scheduling context for thread pools to handle.
//!
//! # Examples
//! The most basic way to run a future is:
//! ```
//! let result = block_on(async { /* some async code */ });
//! ```
//!
//! But this of course doesn't really make it possible to actually run things concurrently, since it
//! just waits for this single future. Instead, you probably want to use a real executor. The main
//! one you probably want is the global executor:
//! ```
//! let result = Task::spawn(async { /* some async code */ }).await;
//! ```
//! Now, this does assume that there is a thread that has called [mod@run()], eg:
//! ```
//! let result = run(async {
//!     Task::spawn(async { /* some async code */ }).await
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! Generally, though, if you want a thread pool, you can spawn a thread into a pool like this:
//! ```
//! std::thread::spawn(|| twizzler_async::run(std::future::pending::<()>()));
//! ```
//!
//! Then, later on, you can spawn a Task and await it. You can also detach a Task with .detach(),
//! which just places the thread on the runqueues and runs it without you having to await the
//! result.
//!
//! # AsyncSetup, and Async<T>
//! Traits and types for asynchronous operations on objects that have generic wait and signal
//! events.
//!
//! For example, a queue might have the following interface presented to the user:
//!    1. `async fn send(T)`
//!    2. `async fn recv() -> T`
//!
//! Making these functions async requires defining some Future that can wait and be signaled when
//! something happens -- say we send and want to wait if the queue is full, or recv and want to wait
//! if the queue is empty, and of course we don't want to busy-wait. The queue can implement
//! [AsyncDuplexSetup] so that we can wrap the queue in a [AsyncDuplex] and then use its functions
//! to access the queue's underlying structures in a non-blocking way, automatically sleeping when
//! necessary.
