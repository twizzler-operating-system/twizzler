//! This library provides a common interface for applications that want to talk to the Twizzler
//! kernel, and defines that interface for both applications and the kernel to follow. It's made of
//! several parts:
//!   1. System Calls -- see [syscall] and [arch::syscall].
//!   2. Other Application-Kernel ABI definitions (e.g. pager queue entries).
//!
//! # Should I use these APIs?
//! All of these interfaces are potentially unstable and should not be used directly by most
//! programs.
