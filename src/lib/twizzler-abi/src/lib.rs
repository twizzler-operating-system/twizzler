//! This library provides a common interface for applications that want to talk to the Twizzler
//! kernel, and defines that interface for both applications and the kernel to follow. It's made of
//! several parts:
//!   1. The Runtime -- see [rt1], [aux], and [exec]
//!   2. System Calls -- see [syscall] and [arch::syscall]
//!   3. The rest, acting as support for the rust standard library.
//!
//! # Should I use these APIs?
//! All of these interfaces are potentially unstable and should not be used directly by most
//! programs. Instead, the twizzler crate can be used to access standard Twizzler object APIs, and
//! the rust standard library should be used for general rust programming. Both of these wrap calls
//! to this library in better, more easily consumed APIs.
