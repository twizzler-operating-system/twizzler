//! A system for handling requests and organizing inflight requests while waiting for responses.
//!
//! The general structure of this system is that software implements the [RequestDriver] trait with
//! some struct that we'll call "the request driver" or just "the driver". The driver is then
//! wrapped by a [Requester], which internally manages the asynchrony of talking to devices.
//!
//! A user of the requester can call the [Requester::submit] or [Requester::submit_for_response]
//! functions to submit a set a requests depending on if the caller wants the responses or just
//! wants to know if the requests succeeded. The reason this distinction is maintained is that
//! collecting responses has an overhead. The requester interacts with the driver to submit the
//! requests.
//!
//! Internally, the requester assigns IDs to requests for use in communicating with the driver.
//! These IDs are not necessarily allocated sequentially and can only be relied upon to be unique
//! while a given request is inflight.
//!
//! Once a request is completed by the driver, the driver should send the response data and ID of
//! the request that completed back to the requester with the [Requester::finish] function. The
//! request manager will then collate the responses for matching with the requests and any errors
//! are tracked. Once all requests in a submitted set have been completed, that set of requests is
//! finished and awaiting on it will return a [SubmitSummary] or a [SubmitSummaryWithResponses].
