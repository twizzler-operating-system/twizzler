//! The Twizzler Runtime API is the core interface definition for Twizzler programs, including startup, execution, and libstd support.
//! It defines a set of traits that, when all implemented, form the full interface that Rust's libstd expects from a Twizzler runtime.
//! 
//! From a high level, a Twizzler program links against Rust's libstd and a particular runtime that will support libstd. That runtime
//! must implement the minimum set of interfaces required by the [Runtime] trait. Libstd then invokes the runtime functions when needed
//! (e.g. allocating memory, exiting a thread, etc.). Other libraries may invoke runtime functions directly as well (bypassing libstd),
//! but note that doing so may not play nicely with libstd's view of the world.
//! 
//! # What does it look like to use the runtime?
//! 
//! When a program (including libstd) wishes to use the runtime, it invokes this library's [get_runtime] function, which will return
//! a reference (a &'static dyn reference) to a type that implements the Runtime trait. From there, runtime functions can be called:
//! ```
//! let runtime = get_runtime();
//! runtime.get_monotonic()
//! ```
//! Note that this function is only exposed if the runtime feature is enabled.
//! 
//! # So who is providing that type that implements [Runtime]?
//! 
//! Another library! Right now, Twizzler defines two runtimes: a "minimal" runtime, and a "reference" runtime. Those are not implemented
//! in this crate. The minimal runtime is implemented as part of the twizzler-abi crate, as it's the most "baremetal" runtime. The
//! reference runtime is implemented as a standalone set of crates. Of course, other runtimes can be implemented, as long as they implement
//! the required interface in this crate, libstd will work.
//! 
//! ## Okay but how does get_runtime work?
//! 
//! Well, [get_runtime] is just a wrapper around calling an extern "C" function, [__twz_get_runtime]. This symbol is external, so not
//! defined in this crate. A crate that implements [Runtime] then defines [__twz_get_runtime], allowing link-time swapping of runtimes.
//! The twizzler-abi crate defines this symbol with (weak linkage)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_symbol], causing it to be linked
//! only if another (strong) definition is not present. Thus, a program can link to a specific runtime, but it can also be loaded by a
//! dynamic linker and have its runtime selected at load time.
